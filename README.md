# Bookshelf Generator

This extension can procedurally creates bookshelves with variable height and width and it fills the shelves with books. It is part of a series of live coding sessions that I am working on. It is currently incomplete, but you can follow along and I continue to develop it.

## App Link Setup

If `app` folder link doesn't exist or broken it can be created again. For better developer experience it is recommended to create a folder link named `app` to the *Omniverse Kit* app installed from *Omniverse Launcher*. Convenience script to use is included.

Run:

```
> link_app.bat
```

If successful you should see `app` folder link in the root of this repo.

If multiple Omniverse apps is installed script will select recommended one. Or you can explicitly pass an app:

```
> link_app.bat --app create
```

You can also just pass a path to create link to:

```
> link_app.bat --path "C:/Users/bob/AppData/Local/ov/pkg/create-2021.3.4"
```


## Sharing Your Extensions

This folder is ready to be pushed to any git repository. Once pushed direct link to a git repository can be added to *Omniverse Kit* extension search paths.

Link might look like this: `git://github.com/mati-nvidia/omni-bookshelf-generator.git?branch=main&dir=exts`

Notice `exts` is repo subfolder with extensions. More information can be found in "Git URL as Extension Search Paths" section of developers manual.

To add a link to your *Omniverse Kit* based app go into: Extension Manager -> Gear Icon -> Extension Search Path
